  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
1) What new skills have you learned?
- MDN was new to me - very helpful resource
- Slack - first time used - I believe this will be a useful resource
I will need to sharpen my skills on this one.

2) What has been easy?
- Understanding the basic structure of HTML - the tree analogy helped me understand how HTML is structured

3) What has been difficult?
- when the words "exactly" are used, I may have worked a little more then expected to exactly match the mockup.
I ended up spending a good amount of time trying to match the mockups to my Windows Chrome Browser. I was starting "play" with font-size and image width, a topic we have not covered.
In trying to match the fire emoji displayed in the mockup, I ended up learning that Apple Safari and MS Windows Chrome do not display the same Unicode the same way. (https://emojipedia.org/fire/)
Actuallyâ€¦ I found differences between different platforms and Apps.
I learned about emojis (https://emojipedia.org/), different Unicode versions and emoji versions.

4) How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
I immediately used the validator (https://validator.w3.org/)
This was a helpful resource in finding syntax errors in my html code.
