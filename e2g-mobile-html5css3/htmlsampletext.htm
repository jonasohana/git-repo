    <h1>Chapter 2: The Lights</h1>
    
    WatzThis has colors. They change when you press different buttons.
    <h1>Chapter 3: "Auto" Mode</h1>   
     
    WatzThis has an automatic mode that's useful for those times when you're doing something else, such as dancing, but would still like to have changing colors on your mobile device.
    
    <h1>Chapter 4: Audio</h1>

    WatzThis has music. The sound and lights make for a great effect. <br>

    Here is a sample of the code<br>
    <code>
        &lt;audio id="myAudio"&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;source src="audio/trance-low.ogg" type="audio/ogg"&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;source src="audio/trance-low.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your browser does not support the audio element.<br />
    &lt;/audio&gt;
    </code>
