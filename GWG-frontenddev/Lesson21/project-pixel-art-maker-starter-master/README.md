## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Design
# JavaScript Loops and Functions
* The student implements while and for loops to clear and create the grid dynamically.

* Student successfully implements makeGrid() and call it upon the user submitting the grid size.

# JavaScript Selectors and Event Listeners
* The student uses selectors to access user input values and select elements in the DOM.

* The student uses event listeners to trigger grid creation, and modify the grid colors.

## Code Quality

* Code is ready for review, meaning new lines and indentation are used for easy readability.

* JavaScript code follows Udacity's styleguide.
